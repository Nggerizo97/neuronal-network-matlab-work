# Genetic Algorithm
The neural network is built without using libraries, you can make use of this code to improve it.

Technical Details

Neural Network Construction:

Implemented a neural network manually, focusing on understanding the fundamental principles without external libraries.
The network consists of layers with adjustable weights and biases.
Arithmetic Equation:

The target function is defined by a specific arithmetic equation.
The network aims to learn and approximate the graph of this equation through training.
Training Process:

The training involves iterating over multiple epochs.
During each epoch, the network adjusts its weights based on the error between the predicted output and the actual target values.
The goal is to minimize this error over time, thereby making the network's output increasingly similar to the target function's graph.
Weight Adjustment:

Dominant weights are identified and adjusted iteratively.
The network uses a gradient descent-like approach to update the weights and reduce the error.
Future Enhancements

Optimization Techniques:

Incorporate more sophisticated optimization algorithms to improve convergence and accuracy.
Experiment with different learning rates and activation functions.
Network Complexity:

Increase the complexity of the network by adding more layers and neurons to better capture the intricacies of the target function.
Error Analysis:

Perform detailed error analysis to identify patterns and improve the network's performance.
Summary

This project demonstrates the construction of a neural network from scratch, aimed at simulating the graph of an arithmetic equation. Through iterative training and weight adjustments, the network learns to approximate the target function. Future enhancements will focus on optimization, increasing network complexity, and detailed error analysis to further improve the model's accuracy and performance.
